## Description

This repository contains an universal chat framework that can be easily scaled to be used in any project that contains standard in-app chat component. This library is divided into multiple modules (layers). Each module is a standalone framework target, so the implementation details can be hidden from each other. Each module is its own pod as well.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

To integrate Chat Component into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:
```
source 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'

target 'TARGET_NAME' do
  # For plug&play solution with predefined MessageKit UI and Firestore backend
  pod 'Chat'

  # If you want to use just some of the layers
  pod 'Chat/Core'
  pod 'Chat/NetworkingFirestore'
  pod 'Chat/UIMessageKit'
end
```

## Initialization

Default chat component implementation uses background fetches and scheduled task and has to be instantiated in app's delegate `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.

## Example

See the [sample app](ChatApp/) for an example how to use this pod.

## Architecture

The library consists of four modules:
* Chat
* ChatCore
* ChatNetworkingFirestore 
* ChatUI

See this diagram for a visual overview of the architecture:

### ChatCore - Essential models and protocols

#### `ChatCore`

The main class that the UI can use for all chat operations. It contains all the necessary methods and implements `ChatCoreServicing` protocol.

#### `DataPayload`

This class carries the data received from a listener (for example collection of conversations) plus the information whether end of the data has been reached. This is useful for the UI to be able to hide "Load more" button for example. It could possibly contain some more meta data in the future.

### ChatNetworkingFirestore - Firestore networking layer (optional)

You can use this pod if your project uses Firestore as the database for the chat. If you need to use another API, you can write your own networking layer. See [Writing custom networking layer](#writing-custom-networking-layer)

### ChatUI - UI using MessageKit (optional)

Simple UI implementation for testing. Most projects will probably want to write their own UI. See [Writing custom UI layer](#writing-custom-ui-layer).

### Chat â€“ Glue
You can use this part of the library in case you want to use existing implementations of `ChatCoreServicing`, `ChatNetworkServicing` and `ChatUIServicing` and you don't need anything custom. It contains the glue code necessary for all of the parts to work. Right now it contains only a chat solution for Pumpkin Pie project, but if you want to consruct your chat from different components, it's very simple. See [Gluing UI layer and networking layer](#gluing-ui-layer-and-networking-layer)

## Writing custom UI layer

The provided UI layer is fairly simple and doesn't offer any customization so usually in a project you will want to create your own UI layer. The only thing that is required is providing the `ChatCore` class with a `ChatUIModels` implementation that specifies which models should be provided to your completion handlers. 

```swift 
class ChatCore<Networking: ChatNetworkServicing, Models: ChatUIModels>: ChatCoreServicing
```

``` swift
public protocol ChatUIModels {
    associatedtype CUI: ConversationRepresenting
    associatedtype MUI: MessageRepresenting
    associatedtype MSUI: MessageSpecifying
    associatedtype USRUI: UserRepresenting
}
```

## Writing custom networking layer

The only thing needed to implement custom networking layer is conforming to the protocol `ChatNetworkServicing` and providing this implementation to `ChatCore` as seen in the next chapter.

## Gluing UI layer and networking layer

Let's take the complete [Pumpkin Pie](Chat/Implementations/PumpkinPie) solution mentioned above as an example.

First, you need your implementations of `ChatNetworkServicing`, `ChatCoreServicing` and `ChatUIServicing`. From now on, let's assume you want to use `ChatCore` as the implementation of `ChatCoreServicing` because it is written generically enough to work with any tuple of implementations of `ChatNetworkServicing` and `ChatUIServicing`. In case of Pumpkin Pie, those implementations are `ChatNetworkFirestore` and `ChatUI`.

Second, you need to make all your networking models conform to `ChatUIConvertible`, for example:

``` swift
extension ConversationFirestore: ChatUIConvertible {
    public var uiModel: Conversation {
      // return Conversation instance created using data from `self`
    }

    public init(uiModel: Conversation) {
      // call self.init using data from `uiModel`
    }
}
```

and make all your UI models conform to `ChatNetworkingConvertible` like this:

```swift
extension Conversation: ChatNetworkingConvertible {
    public typealias NetworkingModel = ConversationFirestore
}
```

Third, you need to make your implementation of `ChatUIServicing` compatible with `ChatCore` simply like this:

``` swift
public class ChatUI<Core: ChatUICoreServicing>: ChatUIServicing {
  ...
}

public protocol ChatUICoreServicing: ChatCoreServicing where C == Conversation, M == MessageKitType, MS == MessageSpecification, U == User { }

extension ChatCore: ChatUICoreServicing where Models.CUI == Conversation, Models.MSUI == MessageSpecification, Models.MUI == MessageKitType, Models.USRUI == User { }
```

Next, you need to wrap your implementation of `ChatUIServicing`in `ChatInterfacing` to manage different instances of UI for different scenes:

``` swift
public class PumpkinPieInterface: ChatInterfacing {
    public let identifier: ObjectIdentifier
    public let uiService: ChatUI<...>    
    public weak var delegate: Delegate?
    public var rootViewController: UIViewController {
        uiService.rootViewController
    }
        
    init(...) {...}
}
```

Finally, you glue everything together by implementing `ChatSpecifying` protocol:

``` swift
public class PumpkinPieChat: DefaultChatSpecifying {
    public typealias UIModels = ChatModelsUI
    public typealias Networking = ChatNetworkingFirestore
    public typealias Core = ChatCore<ChatNetworkingFirestore, UIModels>
    public typealias Interface = PumpkinPieInterface

    public init(...) {...}

    func interface(with identifier: ObjectIdentifier) -> Interface {...}

    func runBackgroundTasks(completion: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) {...}

    func resendUnsentMessages() {...}

    func setCurrentUser(userId: EntityIdentifier, name: String, imageUrl: URL?) {...}
}
```

## Chat core usage

### Listeners

Because chat is a real-time functionality, the client needs to be notified about any new data updates ASAP. That's why fetching conversations and messages is done using a persistent connection. Every time you call `core.listenToConversations` or `core.listenToMessages` you receive a `ChatListener` (just a `String` typealias for now) instance that you must store somewhere. Whenever you are ready to stop listening to this particular set of data, call `core.remove(listener: ChatListener)` so there is no unnecessary network connection left behind.

### Send a message
``` swift
core.send(message: .text(message: "Hello!"), to: currentChatId) { result in

    // Called after successfuly sending a message

    switch result {
    case .success(let message):
        print(message.id)
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```
### Listen to conversations

``` swift
core.listenToConversations { result in

    // Called on every conversations update

    switch result {
    case .success(let payload):
        // payload contains current list of fetched conversations
        // as well as some additional data (see `DataPayload` for more info)
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```

### Listen to messages of a conversation

``` swift
core.listenToMessages(conversation: conversationId) { result in

    // Called on every messages update
    
    switch result {
    case .success(let payload):
        // payload contains current list of fetched conversations
        // as well as some additional data (see `DataPayload` for more info)
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```

### Pagination

Whenever you need to load next page of conversations or messages, simply call `core.loadMoreConversations` or `core.loadMoreMessages` respectively. The existing callbacks that you provided when calling `core.listenTo...` method will be called with updated set of data. (So on the first call to `core.listenToConversations` you will receive 1 &ast; n number of conversations and after calling `core.loadMoreConversations` you will receive 2 &ast; n number of conversations).

### Task management

To make the chat core component well thought out it was enhanced by task manager. The task manager class allows chat core to make calls with extra attributes and handles all logic behind. Using task management impacts on completion handling at chat core itself.

###### Available attributes
- after init
- background task
- background thread
- retry (with retry type finite/infinite)

##### After init

Few calls (e.g. load conversations) can get into the task manager's queue, although chat core is not connected yet. Those tasks remain in the queue and, after the core is loaded, are executed.

##### Background task

Calls attributed background task will try to continue after app goes to the background. At first all tasks are hooked to app's `beginBackgroundTaskWithName:expirationHandler:` method. Secondary if iOS version is 13+ and there are still unfinished tasks in queue, then `BGSCheduledTask` is used to activate the app after some time to retry execution of those tasks. If the chat runs on an older version of iOS then background fetch is used.

##### Background thread

Tasks attributed background thread are run in its own dedicated background thread.

##### Retry

To allow tasks retry there are two options how to do it. Finite with limited amount of attempts and infinite. The infinite type is used for initial loading of the whole chat core. The finite retry type with the default value of attempts equal to 3 is used for sending messages.
**Please note that only the network error comes in place when handling retry, other errors don't count.**

##### Example of call

You can find an example of the send message task method below. The task manager wraps send message network call and applies few attributes on it. In case of using retry attribute, it is necessary to control the response of **taskCompletion** closure, as it is shown in case of failure in the example.

``` swift
taskManager.run(attributes: [.backgroundTask, .afterInit, .backgroundThread, .retry(.finite())]) { [weak self] taskCompletion in
            let mess = Networking.MS(uiModel: message)
            self?.networking.send(message: mess, to: conversation) { result in
                switch result {
                case .success(let message):
                    _ = taskCompletion(.success)
                    completion(.success(message.uiModel))

                case .failure(let error):
                    if taskCompletion(.failure(error)) == .finished {
                        completion(.failure(error))
                    }
                }
            }
        }
``` 

### Chat core states
When chat core is created there are few states which can change during its lifetime. It's possible to observe those changes so UI can react properly. Core contains reachability observer to check network connection availability.

###### Available states
 - initial _after core is created_
 - loading _after init when core tries to connect to service provider and setup all stuff_
 - connected _all loading work is done and core is ready to make its job_
 - connecting _when core is notified that network went off_

### Caching unsent messages

When core sends message, it's automatically stored to local secure cache (keychain). After message is sent (eg. background task) its removed from cache. When sending fails for any reason, user has chance to retry or delete message at UI.
